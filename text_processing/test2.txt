In the quiet of the night,
Underneath the pale moonlight,
A whispering wind does gently play,
Singing songs of the fading day.


Stars above, like diamonds bright,
Twinkle with a soft delight,
Reflecting in the tranquil sea,
A spectacle for all to see.


The rustling leaves, the hooting owl,
The distant wolf's foreboding howl,
Compose a symphony so grand,
Played by nature's unseen band.


So take a moment, pause and see,
The beauty in this mystery,
For life's a poem, can't you tell?
In every moment, stories dwell.
